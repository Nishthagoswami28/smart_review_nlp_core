Perfect product! If you are looking for a calling watch, just go for it. Best watch you can buy under 4000.

Pros:
- Super build quality, looks very premium.
- Very comfortable to wear, good quality strap.
- Touch works well.
- Calling feature works fine. Volume is a bit low outdoors, but mic quality is great.
- Noise has great customer service.

Cons:
- Volume is not loud outdoors.
